        <h1>Dr Ambedkar Memorial Park</h1>
        <p>
          Sprawling across an area of 107 acres in Gomti Nagar, the Ambedkar Memorial Park was built to commemorate the dedication of reformers like Dr BR Ambedkar, Jyotiba Phule, Sree Narayana Guru, Kanshi Ram, Birsa Munda, Shahuji Maharaj and many others, towards equality, humanity and justice. 

          The park is built in red sandstone, all of which was brought from Rajasthan. As you enter the park, a 112-ft-high stupa welcomes you. The stupa is surrounded by pillars, elephant structures and statues of Dr Ambedkar, depicting his life in stone. Resembling a flower with flower petals, the sanctum sanctorum has a statue of him seated, facing the dome. As you move deeper inside, you will come across the Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Sangrahalay, which houses the statues of notaries like Jyotiba Phule, Sree Narayana Guru, and Kanshi Ram. About 18-ft tall marble statues of Gautam Buddha, Kabir Das, and Sant Ravidas etc., can be found in another structure. 

          You can also visit a gallery here where impressive bronze murals have been displayed. A serene getaway, known as Pratibimb Sthal, is guarded on either side by 62 elephant statues, and is beautifully illuminated at night. Finally, for a complete view of the park and shrines, head to the Dr Ambedkar Memorial Drashya Sthal. 

          While the monument is open throughout the year, winter is the best time to visit, when the weather is perfect for strolling in the grounds and exploring the place in its entirety.
