        <h1>Charbagh</h1>
        <p>
          Charbagh Railway Station, one of the two main railway stations in Lucknow, is an architectural marvel that features the best of Rajasthani and Mughal styles, mixed with British influences. The station appears like a chessboard from the sky, with turrets and domes resembling chess pieces. From the front however, it resembles a Rajput palace. Such is the ingenuity of the construction that large water reservoirs are beautifully hidden inside the building. Charbagh was designed by JH Horniman, an Englishman, in 1914. 

          The station holds immense historical importance and it is said that it was the place where Mahatma Gandhi first met Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The opening session of the legislature of Congress in 1916 was also held at Charbagh Railway Station.

          There is a Hanuman temple right outside the station that is also worth a visit. The shrine of Khamman Peer Baba, the final resting place of saint Shah Syed Qayamuddin, also sits close to Charbagh. It is over 900 years old, and has a stunning mosque in the premises. .
